  <h2>Map of Water Level Changes over the Decades</h2>
  <p>
    This map analyzes the average water level dropoff per state, by decade.
    It was calculated as follows: each water well site has coordinates associated with it,
    so we took each pair of coordinates and classified them into states. Then, to calculate dropoff (or water gain),
    we took the measurement from the beginning of the decade (e.g. January 1st, 2000) and the measurement
    at the end of the decade (e.g. December 31st, 2009) for every single well. For every well in a given state,
    this calculation was averaged to get the values you see when you hover over a state. A state is colored red
    if, on average, it has lost water in that decade, or green if it has gained water. The colors grow more intense
    the further these values get from zero. If the value is close to zero, it will be close to a white color.

  <h2>Average Depth to Water Over Time by Sites</h2>
  <p>
    This chart dynamically allows you to select a specific water well site and year to see the average depth to water for the year for the site.
    There are a lot of sites to observe, which is only a small section of all wells cited in our datset. This chart has filtered its data over several factors,
    including removing sites that recorded less than four years of data, with consistent and consecutive yearly averages for water depth, and with 
    generally clean data (no negative numbers, no blank sections in the data, etc.). While this isn't every site that qualified, since there are thousands of
    sites in the United States, it should give the user plenty of data to see how many sites have changed in their depth to water over time.
    The chart is read as a reverse y-axis. For example, the inital reading, Station 943244310 in the year 1964, measures around 26ft until hitting water.
    In 1965, this same site only measured 14 feet to hitting water, a 10 foot average increase based on daily recordings. It is designed to look like a well to
    better represent well depth in an interesting and more "real" setting.
