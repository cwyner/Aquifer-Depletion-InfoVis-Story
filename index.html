  <h2>Map of Water Level Changes over the Decades</h2>
  <p>
    This map analyzes the average water level dropoff per state, by decade.
    It was calculated as follows: each water well site has coordinates associated with it,
    so we took each pair of coordinates and classified them into states. Then, to calculate dropoff (or water gain),
    we took the measurement from the beginning of the decade (e.g. January 1st, 2000) and the measurement
    at the end of the decade (e.g. December 31st, 2009) for every single well. For every well in a given state,
    this calculation was averaged to get the values you see when you hover over a state. A state is colored red
    if, on average, it has lost water in that decade, or green if it has gained water. The colors grow more intense
    the further these values get from zero. If the value is close to zero, it will be close to a white color.
