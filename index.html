      <h1>Well Depletion Across the United States</h1>
      <p>By the Aquabats. Rayan Khan, Holden Rohrer, Niki Wells, Charlie
          Wyner</p>
    </div>

    <p>We collected a large dataset of all the well measurements done by
    the United States Geographic Service from the
    <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis">WaterData portal</a>
    (specifically, the Historical Observations from the Groundwater category).
    This required some non-trivial scraping effort to extract,
    normalize, and combine the data from all 6,047 (!) wells.
    We were left with a massive database of 21 million measurements over
    the course of 105 years, from 1919 to today, where we assessed
    year-on-year variation of wells and found the vast majority to be in
    general decline.</p>

  <h2>Map of Well Locations across the Country</h2>
  <p>Since wells tend to be somewhat geographically correlated, we want
  to examine how they move together as groups in regions. One of the key
  takeaways from this graph is that huge parts of the driest parts of
  California, particular areas of Missouri, and parts of the Pacific
  Northwest have seen drying up over the past few years. This indicates
  clustering due to aquifers moving together in regions, meaning that
  paying attention to water usage in a region with worrisome aquifer
  levels is very important. Furthermore, most of the country has
  declining water levels, causing much worry for the future growth of
  agriculture in the US.</p>

  <h2>Map of Water Level Changes over the Decades</h2>
  <p>
    This map analyzes the average water level dropoff per state, by decade.
    It was calculated as follows: each water well site has coordinates associated with it,
    so we took each pair of coordinates and classified them into states. Then, to calculate dropoff (or water gain),
    we took the measurement from the beginning of the decade (e.g. January 1st, 2000) and the measurement
    at the end of the decade (e.g. December 31st, 2009) for every single well. For every well in a given state,
    this calculation was averaged to get the values you see when you hover over a state. A state is colored red
    if, on average, it has lost water in that decade, or green if it has gained water. The colors grow more intense
    the further these values get from zero. If the value is close to zero, it will be close to a white color.
